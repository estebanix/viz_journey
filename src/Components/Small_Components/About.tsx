            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Sam and I welcome you to my website. I'm a programmer and ex-bioarchaeologist who likes to create data visualizations or wrestle on the mat in his free time. It was the connection of both my fields that led me to love visualization. I like to visualize just about everything, from stable isotope values ​​to my Espresso Tonic consumption over the the year.</p>
