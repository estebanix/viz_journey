            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Sam and I welcome you to my website. I'm a programmer and ex-bioarchaeologist who likes to create data visualizations or wrestle on the mat in his free time. It was the connection of both my fields that led me to love visualization. I like to visualize just about everything, from stable isotope values to my <span>Espresso Tonic consumption</span> over the the year.</p>
            <p>My first experience with programming was in elementary school. My older cousin taught me how to create a calculator in C++. With my choice of high school it was clear - definitely IT. But ironically, high school disgusted me so much with programming that I went to college for the major I wanted to do as a kid, archaeology. There I focused on studying diet reconstruction and provenance based on <span>stable isotope analyses</span>. While writing my thesis, which was awarded by the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, because of my work with bioarchaeological data, I became more and more interested in how to visualize it properly. This was the initial impulse to return to programming. </p>
            <p>And then it all went at once. I totally fell into programming and I have been programming ever since. Although the initial plan was to focus on data-sience, I got into React, and it was love at first sight. I enjoy working with it extremely much, and so I've succumbed to that, creating data visualizations in conjunction <span>with D3</span>. It's this powerful duo that can turn input data into beautiful and interactive visualizations that look great in a scientific paper or as part of a website. See for yourself...and remember, <span>stay curious!</span></p>
